This is a grocery ingredient aggregation service created by @Echen1246. 


I built this after noticing a pattern of my purchased produce going bad. At the time of shopping, I'd think I'd need this ingredient down the line for some dish I hadn't planned, or an addition to something else. These plans usually don't pan out, and our onions, leafy greens, even potatoes would go bad after a period of time. Let's change that.


You can select from a list of default recipes. Sort by protein groups or search up your favorite dish. New recipes will be added weekly according to user demand. Recipes will be shown in carts, with the option to download or send yourself an aggregate list of ingredients to use at the grocer. 



Planned:
The future of online shopping is agentic. Why not have AI agents do price comparisons with our shopping list, and find the best location to buy our ingredients?
